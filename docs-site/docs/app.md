# Menu Bar App

The devmux menu bar app is a native macOS companion that lives in your
menu bar and gives you quick access to all your devmux sessions.

## Installation

```bash
devmux app          # Build (or download) and launch
devmux app build    # Rebuild from source
devmux app restart  # Quit, rebuild, relaunch
devmux app quit     # Stop the app
```

The first run builds from source if Swift is available, otherwise
downloads a pre-built binary from GitHub releases.

## Command palette

Press **Cmd+Shift+M** from anywhere to open the command palette.
It's a searchable list of every action the app can perform, with
fuzzy matching on titles and subtitles.

### App commands

| Command           | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Settings          | Open preferences (terminal, scan root)   |
| Diagnostics       | View logs and debug info                 |
| Refresh Projects  | Re-scan for .devmux.json configs         |
| Quit Devmux       | Exit the menu bar app                    |

## Project discovery

The app scans a configurable root directory (up to 3 levels deep)
for `.devmux.json` files. It skips `.git/` and `node_modules/`.

Auto-detection for the scan root checks these paths in order:
`~/dev`, `~/Developer`, `~/projects`, `~/src`.

For each project found, the app reads:
- Pane names and commands from `.devmux.json`
- Dev command and package manager from `package.json`
- Running status by checking `tmux has-session`

## Session management

The app calls the devmux CLI for session operations:

- **Launch** — runs `devmux` in the project directory, which creates
  or reattaches to the session
- **Sync** — runs `devmux sync` to reconcile panes to the config
- **Restart** — runs `devmux restart <pane>` to kill and re-run a
  specific pane's process
- **Detach** — calls `tmux detach-client` directly
- **Kill** — calls `tmux kill-session` directly

## Window tiling

The app can tile terminal windows to preset screen positions via
the command palette. It finds windows by their `[devmux:session-name]`
title tag.

For Terminal.app and iTerm2, tiling uses AppleScript to set window
bounds by matching the title tag. For other terminals, it tiles the
frontmost window.

### Tile positions (app)

| Position     | Area                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Left         | Left half                       |
| Right        | Right half                      |
| Top Left     | Top-left quarter                |
| Top Right    | Top-right quarter               |
| Bottom Left  | Bottom-left quarter             |
| Bottom Right | Bottom-right quarter            |
| Maximize     | Full visible screen             |
| Center       | 70% width, 80% height, centered |

## Space navigation

"Go to" commands can switch macOS Spaces to reach a window on a
different desktop. The app uses a three-path fallback:

1. **CGWindowList** (needs Screen Recording) — looks up the window
   by title tag, finds its Space via SkyLight, switches to it, then
   raises the window
2. **Accessibility API** (needs Accessibility) — finds the window
   via AXUIElement, raises it, and activates the app
3. **AppleScript** — iterates windows by name for Terminal/iTerm2,
   or bare-activates for other terminals

When a window is found and focused, the app flashes a green border
highlight around it for ~1 second so you can spot it immediately.

Grant Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions in System
Settings > Privacy & Security for the best experience.

## Settings

Open via the command palette or the gear icon in the main view.
The settings window has three tabs:

### General

| Setting    | Description                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Terminal   | Which terminal to use (auto-detected from installed) |
| Mode       | `learning` or `auto` (see below)                     |
| Scan Root  | Directory to scan for .devmux.json configs (type a path or click Browse) |

**Mode** controls how the app handles session interaction:

- **Learning** — shows tmux keybinding hints when you detach
  (helpful while getting used to tmux)
- **Auto** — detaches sessions automatically (fewer prompts)

### Shortcuts

Shows keyboard shortcut reference:

| Shortcut          | Action              |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Cmd+Shift+M       | Open command palette |
| Ctrl+B  D         | Detach from session  |
| Ctrl+B  X         | Kill current pane    |
| Ctrl+B  Left/Right| Move between panes   |
| Ctrl+B  Z         | Zoom pane (toggle)   |
| Ctrl+B  [         | Scroll mode          |

### Docs

Embedded quick reference with glossary, "how it works" steps, and
links to open the full `config.md` and `concepts.md` docs.

## Supported terminals

| Terminal     | Launch | Focus/Attach | Tile by tag |
|--------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Terminal.app | yes    | yes          | yes         |
| iTerm2       | yes    | yes          | yes         |
| Warp         | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Ghostty      | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Kitty        | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |
| Alacritty    | yes    | activate     | frontmost   |

"yes" means full AppleScript-based window matching by title tag.
"activate" means the app is brought to front but a specific window
can't be targeted. "frontmost" means tiling applies to whatever
window is in front.

## Diagnostics

The diagnostics panel shows a timestamped log of window navigation
attempts, including which path succeeded or failed. Useful for
debugging Screen Recording / Accessibility permission issues.
