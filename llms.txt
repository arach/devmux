## Concepts

devmux is a developer workspace launcher. It creates pre-configured
terminal layouts for your projects using tmux, so you can go from
"I want to work on X" to a full development environment in one click.

## Config

Place a `.devmux.json` file in your project root to define your
workspace layout. devmux reads this file when creating a session.

## App

The devmux menu bar app is a native macOS companion that lives in your
menu bar and gives you quick access to all your devmux sessions.
